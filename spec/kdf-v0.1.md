# KDF v0.1 — Specification Index

This document defines the structure of the KDF specification.

The following documents are NORMATIVE and MUST be followed
for any implementation claiming KDF compliance:

- LOSSLESS.md
- EVIDENCE_ADDRESSING.md
- CONFORMANCE.md
- STYLE_GUIDE.md

All requirements use RFC 2119 terminology (MUST, SHOULD, MAY).

Artifacts failing the conformance suite are NOT KDF-compliant.
