# KDF Governance Model

## Principles
1. Correctness over convenience
2. Stability over speed
3. Explicitness over inference
4. Governance over automation

## Authority
KDF is governed under a Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) model.
The BDFL has final authority over:
- Specification changes
- Terminology definitions
- Conformance requirements
- Version releases

## Change Process
All changes require a written proposal (KDF-EP) including:
- Motivation
- Design
- Compatibility impact
- Concrete examples

Consensus is advisory, not binding.

## Versioning
- Major versions may introduce breaking changes
- Minor versions may add optional fields only
- Patch versions clarify wording only

## Non-Goals
- KDF does not standardize extraction
- KDF does not infer or interpret knowledge
- KDF does not evaluate truthfulness of sources

Future governance may evolve only after multiple independent compliant
implementations exist.
