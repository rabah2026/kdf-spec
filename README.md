# KDF — Knowledge-Dense Format

KDF (Knowledge-Dense Format) is an evidence-grounded, auditable knowledge
representation format for AI systems operating on authoritative sources.

KDF represents explicit statements from source documents as verifiable
knowledge atoms, each linked to inspectable evidence.

The specification prioritizes correctness, auditability, and governance
over automation, inference, or convenience.

If it cannot be proven, it is not KDF.
